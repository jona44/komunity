      - App restart currently logs the user out
      - Persist auth token in secure storage
      - Auto-login on app launch if token exists
      - Files: mobile/App.tsx, mobile/src/api/client.ts

[ ] 2. Password Reset on Mobile
      - Add "Forgot Password?" link on LoginScreen
      - Create PasswordResetScreen (email input → backend sends reset email)
      - Backend already supports: /password-reset/, /password-reset-confirm/

      - GroupDetailScreen (members preview)
      - GroupManagementScreen (members + deceased)
      - WalletScreen already has it ✅
      - Use React Native RefreshControl component

[ ] 4. Reply to Comments on Mobile
      - PostDetailScreen currently shows replies but can't create them
      - Add reply input for each comment
      - API exists: ReplyViewSet (POST /api/v1/replies/)
      - Files: mobile/src/screens/PostDetailScreen.tsx

[ ] 5. Edit/Delete Own Comments on Mobile
      - Add edit and delete actions to own comments
      - Show context menu (long-press or ... button)
      - API exists: CommentViewSet supports PUT/PATCH/DELETE
      - Files: mobile/src/screens/PostDetailScreen.tsx


========================================
  PHASE 2 — ENHANCED ENGAGEMENT
========================================

      - New post in your group
      - Contribution received
      - Membership approved/rejected
      - Deceased member declared
      - Funds disbursed
      - Requires: backend notification model + FCM/APNs setup
      - Package: expo-notifications

[ ] 7. Edit Posts on Mobile
      - Users can create and delete but can't edit posts
      - Add edit button on own posts in PostDetailScreen
      - API supports PATCH on PostViewSet
      - Files: mobile/src/screens/PostDetailScreen.tsx (new EditPostScreen?)

[ ] 8. Search on Mobile
      - Web has search across groups and members
      - Add search bar to HomeScreen and/or DiscoveryScreen
      - Backend: chema/views.py search_view exists
      - Need API endpoint for search (or use existing group list with query param)

[ ] 9. Contributions List/History on Mobile
      - Web has rich contribution tracking page with filters
      - Mobile only handles contribution creation
      - Add ContributionsScreen showing history per group/deceased
      - API: ContributionViewSet exists

[ ] 10. Edit Group on Mobile (Admin)

       - Add edit group name, description, cover image
       - API supports PATCH on GroupViewSet
       - Files: new screen or modal in GroupDetailScreen


========================================
  PHASE 3 — POLISH & GROWTH
========================================

[ ] 11. Animated Page Transitions
       - Current screen switches are instant cuts
       - Add react-native-reanimated or react-navigation for smooth transitions
       - Consider shared element transitions for group cards → detail

[ ] 12. Pagination for Feeds
       - No FlatList pagination currently — loads all data at once
       - Add infinite scroll to GroupFeedScreen, DiscoveryScreen, contributions
       - Backend: add ?page= and ?page_size= to viewsets (DRF pagination)

[ ] 13. Camera Integration
       - Currently only gallery picker for profile/post photos
       - Add option to take photo directly with expo-camera
       - Files: ProfileSetupScreen, ProfileScreen, CreatePostScreen

[ ] 14. Biometric Auth for Wallet Transactions
       - Use expo-local-authentication for fingerprint/face ID
       - Require biometric before: send money, top-up, disburse funds
       - Package: expo-local-authentication

[ ] 15. Deep Linking
       - Open specific group/post from notification or shared URL
       - Configure URL scheme in app.json
       - Package: expo-linking

[ ] 16. Image Caching
       - No image caching — scroll performance suffers with many profile pics
       - Switch to expo-image (built-in caching, blurhash, transitions)
       - Replace <Image> with <ExpoImage> across screens

[ ] 17. Loading Skeletons
       - Replace ActivityIndicator spinners with shimmer placeholders
       - More polished loading experience
       - Consider: react-native-skeleton-placeholder or custom

[ ] 18. Haptic Feedback
       - Add tactile feedback on: like, send money, join, approve member
       - Package: expo-haptics
       - Quick win for premium feel

[ ] 19. Share Posts
       - Allow users to share posts outside the app
       - Use Expo Share API
       - Add share button to post footer (currently has placeholder 🚀 share)

[ ] 20. Invite via Contacts (Future)
       - Let users invite friends to join communities
       - Package: expo-contacts
       - Needs backend invite/referral system


========================================
  WEB-ONLY FEATURES (Not needed on mobile)
========================================

  - CSV Upload (bulk member import) — admin tool, web-only is fine
  - Post Approval flow — admin tool, low priority for mobile
  - HTMX interactions — web-specific, native has its own patterns


========================================
  INVERTED GAPS (Mobile has, Web doesn't)
========================================

[ ] 21. Post Likes on Web
       - Mobile has like/unlike, web doesn't
       - Add HTMX like button to web post template

[ ] 22. P2P Wallet Transfers on Web
       - Mobile has send money to members, web doesn't
       - Add P2P transfer view/template to wallet app

       - Mobile has unread badge on Discussion Feed button
       - Port to web using last_viewed_at field (already in DB)


========================================
  BUGS & TECH DEBT
========================================

[ ] 24. Lint Errors in ProfileScreen.tsx
       - Several lint warnings from profile picture implementation
       - Review and clean up

[ ] 25. Discovery Screen — Filter Out Joined Groups
       - Currently shows ALL groups including ones user is already in
       - Backend should exclude user's groups from discovery list

[ ] 26. Error Boundaries
       - No error boundaries in the React Native app
       - A crash in any screen crashes the whole app
       - Add ErrorBoundary component wrapping main screens

[ ] 27. Input Validation
       - Client-side validation is minimal
       - Add proper validation for: phone numbers, amounts, dates
       - Show inline error messages
